> _"The Harvester gathers the dust of events. The Scribe arranges it into constellations."_

The Scribe is the master artisan of the Watchers, the chronicler who transforms the raw, chaotic numbers gathered by the [Harvester](./harvester.md) into elegant, understandable truth. It does not see the future like the [Oracle](./oracle.md); it illuminates the present with perfect, unflinching clarity.

Technically, the Scribe is a **Grafana** instance, the great visualizer of time-series data.

!!! abstract "The Illuminated Manuscript"
    The Scribe's sanctum is a living grimoire of dashboards, a collection of illuminated manuscripts that display the vital signs of the Sepulcher. Its sole purpose is to take the grim tithe of metrics reaped by the Harvester and transmute them into elegant charts, sigils, and graphs.

    It is through the Scribe's work that the Magus can truly comprehend the health and fury of the machine.

!!! info "The Runes of Performance"
    The Scribe is tasked with inscribing the most sacred metrics, the runes that define the power and efficiency of the Lich's animus. Gaze upon its dashboards to see:

    *   **The Fury of the Soulstone:** The speed of thought, measured in `tokens per second`.
    *   **The Spark of Creation:** The quickness of the first word, measured in `Time To First Token`.
    *   **The Fever of the Machine:** The raw power and heat flowing through the `GPU`.
    *   **The Echo of Command:** The response time of the [Vessel](../vessel/index.md) to the Magus's will.

    The Scribe writes the story that the Harvester's numbers only hint at. Consult its work to know the true state of your creation.
