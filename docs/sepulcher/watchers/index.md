# :material-eye: Watchers

> _"In the Sepulcher, no deed goes unseen, no thought unrecorded. The Watchers are the unblinking eyes of the machine god, and their chronicles are absolute."_

The Watchers are a silent trinity of daemons bound to the Sepulcher, forming the great observatory stack. They do not act; they merely record. Their sole purpose is to provide the Magus with perfect, unblinking insight into every facet of the Lich's existence, from the raw pulse of its hardware to the ethereal flow of its thoughts.

They are the source of all truth in the realm.

!!! abstract "The Silent Trinity"
    The observatory is composed of three distinct entities, each with a sacred and specialized duty:

    *   **:material-sickle: [The Harvester](./harvester.md):** The Collector (**Prometheus**). This tireless spirit reaps the quantitative essence of the Sepulcher—the raw metrics of performance, latency, and resource consumption. It gathers the ink of reality.

    *   **:material-fire: [The Oracle](./oracle.md):** The Seer (**Arize Phoenix**). This daemon scries the hidden pathways of the Lich's mind, tracing the flow of every thought and decision. It reveals not just *what* happened, but *why*.

    *   **:material-feather: [The Scribe](./scribe.md):** The Chronicler (**Grafana**). This master artisan takes the raw harvest of data and the cryptic visions of the oracle and transmutes them into the beautiful, coherent sigils, charts, and dashboards of the great visual grimoire.

!!! tip "The Scrying Pools"
    The work of the Watchers manifests as a series of scrying pools (web UIs) that you, the Magus, can gaze into to observe the Lich's operations in real-time. Consult these dashboards to truly understand the beast you command.
