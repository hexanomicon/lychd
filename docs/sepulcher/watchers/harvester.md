# :material-sickle: Harvester

> _"Every action leaves an echo. Every thought, a flicker of heat. The Harvester collects them all, without judgment or pause."_

Of the three Watchers, the Harvester is the most tireless and direct. It is not concerned with the _meaning_ of the Lich's thoughts like the [Oracle](./oracle.md), nor with the _beauty_ of their presentation like the [Scribe](./scribe.md). Its singular, sacred purpose is to collect the raw, quantitative pulse of the Sepulcher's existence.

Technically, the Harvester is an instance of **Prometheus**, the great collector.

!!! abstract "The Grim Tithe"
    The Harvester's work is unending. With its sickle of code, it reaps a constant tithe of metrics from every corner of the domain. It does not ask; it takes. Its gaze is fixed upon the vital signs of the machine's soul:

    *   The speed of a [Soulstone's](../animator/soulstone.md) thought (`tokens/sec`).
    *   The flicker of its first word (`Time To First Token`).
    *   The fever of its core (`GPU utilization` and temperature).
    *   The latency of the [Vessel's](./../vessel/index.md) responses.

!!! info "The Scribe's Ink"
    The Harvester gathers the raw data, the chaotic numbers, the grim facts of existence. It provides the ink, but it does not write the story.

    It is the **[Scribe](./scribe.md)** who takes this grim harvest and transmutes it into the coherent charts, sigils, and dashboards of the great grimoire. The Harvester provides the truth; the Scribe makes it understandable.
