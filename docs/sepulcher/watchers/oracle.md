# :material-crystal-ball: Oracle

> _"The Harvester counts the heartbeats, but the Oracle reads the dreams between them."_

While the other Watchers observe the physical realm, the Oracle's gaze pierces the veil of causality. It is the Seer of the Sepulcher, dedicated to understanding not just _what_ the Lich does, but the intricate, branching pathways of _why_.

Technically, the Oracle is a manifestation of **Arize Phoenix**, the great scrying pool for tracing the cognitive threads of intelligent agents.

!!! abstract "The Seer of Causal Chains"
    The Oracle's gift is to perceive the invisible threads of **Intent**.

    When the Lich thinks, the Oracle watches. It records a perfect, luminous trace of the entire cognitive process. It reveals:

    *   **The Narrative:** The full, branching story of an AI's decision-making.
    *   **The Invocation:** Every tool called, every spell cast, every function invoked in the chain.
    *   **The Whisper:** The raw prompts and hidden responses exchanged with the [Soulstone](../../animator/soulstone.md).

!!! info "The Instrument of Albedo"
    The Oracle is the primary tool of the **[Rite of Albedo](../../divination/transcendence/index.md)**.

    When the [Ghouls](../../vessel/ghouls.md) enter the **[Shadow Realm](../../vessel/shadow_realm.md)** to perform Speculative Execution, it is the Oracle that captures their dreams.

    The Magus gazes into the Oracle (the Phoenix UI) to judge these timelines. You look at the traces. You see where the logic held and where it broke. You identify the "White Truths" amidst the hallucinations. Without the Oracle, the Shadow Realm is blind; with it, it is a laboratory of truth.

!!! tip "The Covenant with the Phylactery"
    The visions of the Oracle are too vital to be ephemeral. A sacred covenant has been forged, granting the Oracle a dedicated chamber within the **[Phylactery](../../phylactery/index.md)** itself.

    Its findings are not written to a simple log file, but inscribed directly into the shared PostgreSQL instance. This ensures that every trace, every accepted thought-process, becomes part of the permanent **Karma** of the system, waiting to be used in the **[Soulforge](../phylactery/soulforge.md)**.
