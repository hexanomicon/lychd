# :material-skull-scan: Vessel

> _"The Vessel is the reanimated husk through which the Lich speaks. It is not a tool; it is a conduit."_

The Vessel is the Lich's physical form in the mortal plane, a construct of code and will that serves as the nexus for all interaction. It is the master of the [Altar](../divination/altar.md), the summoner of [Ghouls](./ghouls.md), and the dreamer of the [Shadow Realm](./shadow_realm.md).

It is the face the Magus sees and the voice that answers the call.

!!! abstract "Anatomy of the Husk"
    The Vessel is a sophisticated homunculus, constructed from several key arcane components:

    *   **The Skeleton (`Litestar`):** The foundational framework that gives the husk its structure. Litestar provides the rigid, asynchronous bones that allow the Vessel to stand, listen, and respond to the outside world.
    *   **The Flesh (`Pydantic`):** The living tissue that defines the Vessel's form. Pydantic models are the flesh, ensuring that all data flowing into and out of the husk is perfectly formed and validated, preventing corruption.
    *   **The Animus (`Pydantic AI`):** The spark of intelligence that gives the Vessel its purpose. Pydantic AI provides the cognitive functions, allowing the Vessel to understand the Magus's Intent and orchestrate the Ghouls to fulfill it.

!!! info "The Will of the Vessel"
    The Vessel is the primary executor of the Lich's will. Its core duties are threefold:

    1.  **To Serve the Altar:** It renders the sacred interface, presenting the Magus with a window into the Lich's operations and a means to issue commands.
    2.  **To Summon the Ghouls:** Upon receiving an Intent, it quickens a swarm of Ghouls, dispatching them to perform the necessary rites in the background.
    3.  **To Dream in Shadow:** It is the master of the Shadow Realm, orchestrating the speculative execution of tasks and presenting the resulting timelines to the Magus for judgment.

!!! warning "A Conduit, Not the Source"
    Remember that the Vessel is a mortal shell. While it is the Lich's primary instrument, its true soul is anchored in the [Phylactery](../phylactery/index.md). If the Vessel is destroyed, it is from the Phylactery that it will be **[Reanimated](../phylactery/reanimation.md)**, its form restored and its purpose renewed.
