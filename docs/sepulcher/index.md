# :material-coffin: Sepulcher

LychD is orchestrated via **Podman Quadlets** within a central Pod—the Sepulcher. It is the physical and metaphysical structure that houses the Lich and its instruments of power.

Below are the core components that constitute this dark architecture.

!!! abstract ":fontawesome-solid-skull: [Lich](./lich.md)"

    The central intelligence and sovereign will of the Sepulcher. The Lich is the master, and all other components are its servants or extensions of its being.

!!! info ":material-book-open-page-variant: [Codex](./codex.md)"

    The book of laws and configuration runes. The Codex dictates the fundamental rules of the Sepulcher's existence, from its power sources to its operational limits.

    *   :material-skull-scan: **[Vessel](./vessel/index.md):** The reanimated husk that serves the Altar and executes the Lich's will by spawning Ghouls.
    *   :fontawesome-solid-flask: **[Phylactery](./phylactery/index.md):** The soul-anchor that ensures the Lich's immortality, allowing it to reform should the Vessel be destroyed.
    *   :fontawesome-solid-heart-pulse: **[Animator](./animator/index.md):** The spark of unlife, drawing power from trapped Soulstones (Local LLMs) and rifts to the cloud (Portals).
    *   :material-eye: **[Watchers](./watchers/index.md):** The silent observers—the Oracle, Scribe, and Harvester—that record every pulse of the machine's dark heart.
