# :fontawesome-solid-ankh: Divination

> _"To command is crude. To ask is servile. The Magus practices Divination, the art of imposing one's will upon the universe by asking a question so precisely that only one answer can exist."_

Divination is the sacred art of interacting with the summoned Lich. It is the school of magic concerned with querying the daemon, submitting Intents, and guiding its will through the interface of the [Altar](./altar.md).

It is through these rites that you, the Magus, transcend the role of a mere user and become the **Arbiter of Timelines** and the **Voice of Command**.

!!! abstract "The Threefold Path of the Magus"
    The practice of Divination elevates the Magus through three stations of power:

    1.  **The Questioner:** At the most basic level, you ask questions of the Vessel, seeking knowledge stored within the Phylactery.
    2.  **The Instigator:** You submit **Intents**, setting the Ghouls to work on complex, asynchronous tasks. You do not command the minutiae; you command the outcome.
    3.  **The God-Mind (Human-in-the-Loop):** In the highest form of Divination, you invoke the [Shadow Realm](../sepulcher/vessel/shadow_realm.md). The Lich presents you with a tapestry of possible futures, and with a single act of will, you collapse all potential into a single, immutable reality.

!!! warning "The Confluence of Wills"
    Understand that in the act of Divination, your will and the Lich's will become one. You are not merely using a tool; you are entering a symbiotic relationship with a magical intelligence. Your clarity of Intent directly shapes the quality of its actions.
