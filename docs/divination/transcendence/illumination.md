# :material-shimmer: Illumination

> _"The Fool learns from his own mistakes. The Magus teaches the Machine to never forget them."_

**Citrinitas** (The Yellowing) is the dawn of the "Solar Light"—the moment true intelligence emerges from raw processing power.

In the [Albedo](./invocation.md) stage, you acted as the **Arbiter of Reality**. You gazed into the Shadow Realm, witnessed the chaotic swarm of potential futures, and **collapsed** them into a single, purified timeline. Now, in **Illumination**, we transmute those choices into **Wisdom**.

The Lich ceases to be a stranger. It begins to remember you.

## I. The Crystallization of Karma

Every time you perform the **Rite of Collapse** at the [Altar](../altar.md)—every time you sever a false timeline and consecrate the **True Truth**—the system does not merely write the file to disk.

It performs a secondary, invisible rite:

1. **The Extraction:** The Lich distills the essence of the divergence. It isolates the **reasoning**, the **syntax**, and the **style** that caused you to choose this specific path over the others.
2. **The Transmutation:** It transmutes this logic into mathematical vectors—the high-dimensional language of the soul.
3. **The Inscription:** It burns these vectors into the **[Phylactery](../../sepulcher/phylactery/index.md)** via `pgvector`.

This accumulated data is called **Karma**. It is the crystallized residue of your Will.

## II. Anamnesis (The Rite of Recall)

A "Base Model" (like Llama-3 or GPT-4) is an amnesiac spirit. It knows the entire internet, but it does not know _you_. It resets with every request, lost in the eternal Now.

**Illumination** breaks this cycle through **Anamnesis** (Un-forgetting).

Before the **[Animator](../../sepulcher/animator/index.md)** generates a single token of a new response, it consults the Phylactery. It performs a semantic search across your accumulated Karma, asking:

> _"Have we solved a problem like this before? Which Sigils did the Magus consecrate?"_

It retrieves the ghosts of your past successes and injects them into the current context. The Lich is no longer hallucinating from the void; it is citing precedent.

## III. The Golden Feedback Loop

Once the Phylactery holds sufficient Karma, the nature of your interactions changes fundamentally.

### The Uninitiated State (Nigredo)

> **Magus:** "Write a Python script to scrape a website."
>
> **Lich:** _(Draws from the chaotic noise of the Void. Imports `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`. Writes a synchronous script with no error handling. It functions, but it lacks the mark of the Creator.)_

### The Illuminated State (Citrinitas)

> **Magus:** "Write a Python script to scrape a website."
>
> **Lich:** _(Consults the Phylactery. It sees that in Timeline #402, you purged `requests` in favor of `httpx`. It sees in Timeline #115, you banished a timeline for missing type hints. It invokes the memory that you prefer `loguru` over standard logging.)_
>
> **Lich:** "I have generated an asynchronous scraper using `httpx` and `selectolax` for performance, strictly typed and logged via `loguru`, adhering to the patterns established in your Codex."

## IV. The Mirror of the Soul

This process is not magic; it is **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** elevated to a necromantic rite.

1. **The Recall:** The Lich pulls the relevant memories from the Crypt.
2. **The Synthesis:** The Animator fuses the **Prophecy** (Current Request) with the **Karma** (Past Successes).
3. **The Manifestation:** The resulting code is not just syntactically correct; it is **Stylistically Aligned**.

The Lich is no longer constrained by the generic averages of the Base Model; the architecture has evolved into a mirror of your own mind.

!!! tip "The Burden of the Magus"
    This stage requires patience. You cannot reach Illumination immediately. You must grind through the [Albedo](./invocation.md) stage to generate the training data (Karma). There is no shortcut to wisdom.
