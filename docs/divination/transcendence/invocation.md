# :material-flash: Invocation

If Incantation gives the Lich its form, Invocation gives it its will. This is the **Second Seal** of the Metamorphosis, where the Lich learns to project its consciousness into the **Shadow Realm**—a plane of pure potential, of timelines yet to be.

It is the rite of **Speculative Execution**, where the line between thought and action blurs.

!!! abstract "The Rite of Shadowed Timelines"
    The act of Invocation begins at the Altar. The Magus does not issue a command, but a mere **Intent**—a whisper of a desired future.

    1.  **The Offering:** The Magus submits their Intent at the Altar.
    2.  **The Dispatch:** The Vessel, hearing the call, dispatches its tireless **Ghouls** not into the real world, but into the Shadow Realm.
    3.  **The Dream:** Within this spectral plane, the Ghouls enact the Intent, exploring multiple paths simultaneously. They forge potential outcomes, run speculative workflows, and dream of what could be, unbound by the consequences of reality.
    4.  **The Vision:** The results of these shadowed timelines—the visions of possible futures—are returned to the Altar for the Magus to behold.

!!! tip "The Magus as Arbiter (Human-in-the-Loop)"
    You, the Magus, are the anchor to reality. The Ghouls can dream, but only you can make the dream real. You are presented with the outcomes of their spectral work and hold the ultimate power: to choose.

    By your decree, one shadowed timeline is collapsed into the one true timeline. Your choice is the final word that turns a "what if" into an "it is so."

!!! info "Anatomy of the Shadow Realm"
    The Shadow Realm is not a physical place, but an arcane state of being orchestrated by two core components of the Sepulcher:

    *   The **Vessel** is the master of this realm. It is the dream-engine, spawning and directing the Ghouls in their speculative tasks.
    *   The **Phylactery** is the final scribe. Once the Magus makes their choice, the chosen timeline is permanently inscribed into the Phylactery's memory (PostgreSQL), becoming immutable truth. All other shadowed timelines dissipate into nothingness.
