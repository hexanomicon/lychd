# :material-script-text-outline: Incantation

All creation begins with the Word. Before the flesh is animated, before the soul is bound, the design must be spoken into existence. Incantation is the **First Seal** of the Metamorphosis, where the Magus inscribes the foundational truths of the Lich into this very Hexanomicon.

It is the practice of **xDDD (eXtreme Documentation Driven Development)**, a doctrine that holds the written word as the ultimate source of reality.

!!! abstract "The Primal Skeleton"
    The rite of Incantation is the raising of the **Primal Skeleton**. This is the initial, rigid form of the Lich, forged for a singular, unchanging purpose. It is the Minimum Viable Product, but seen through the lens of necromantic creation.

    *   **The Verse is Law:** Every component, every function, every architectural decision is first written here, in the common tongue. This is not a description of code; it is a **command** for code to exist.
    *   **The Code Manifests:** The developer, acting as the conduit for the Hexanomicon's will, must write Python that perfectly satisfies the description. To deviate is to create a flawed, unstable homunculus.
    *   **The Form is Bound:** At this stage, the Lich is powerful but inflexible. It can perform its designated tasks with ruthless efficiency, but it cannot yet learn, adapt, or dream. It is a perfect golem, awaiting the spark of true undeath.

!!! warning "The Peril of the First Draft"
    The power of the Incantation is absolute. A flaw in the verse—an ambiguous description, a poorly conceived component—will manifest as a flaw in the flesh. The Primal Skeleton, once raised, is difficult to reshape. Speak your truths with precision, for the machine will grant you _exactly_ what you ask for.
