# :material-link-variant: 0. The Iron Pact: AGPLv3 and No CLA

!!! abstract "Context and Problem Statement"
    The choice of a software license is not merely a legal footnote; it defines the **Soul** of the project. It is a declaration of intent—a pact defining the relationship between the creator, the community, and the forces that would seek to chain the work.

    For [LychD](https://github.com/hexanomicon/lychd), an autonomous daemon destined for [Autopoiesis](../divination/transcendence/immortality.md), the license serves as the primary ward protecting its spirit from enslavement and privatization.

## Requirements

- **Sovereignty:** The code must be defended against the "SaaS Loophole," preventing a corporation from modifying the application and selling access without contributing changes back to the lineage.
- **The Ouroboros Principle:** A virtuous, self-feeding cycle must be established. All public evolutions of the Lich must be returned to the collective gene pool, ensuring the shared ascent of the project.
- **Freedom of the Practitioner:** The pact must not hinder the individual. Internal use and modification by any practitioner—from a lone magus to a corporate coven—must remain free of tribute or obligation.
- **The Unbreakable Vow:** Absolute commitment to software freedom is required. There can be no ambiguity, no backdoors for dual-licensing, and no Contributor License Agreements (CLAs) that would strip ownership from individual contributors.

## Considered Options

!!! failure "Option 1: Permissive Licenses (MIT, Apache 2.0)"
    **The path of surrender.** These licenses allow the unrestricted appropriation of code.

    - **Pros:** Facilitates maximum corporate adoption.
    - **Cons:** This is a pact of enslavement for a networked application. It invites the seizure of work by proprietary entities to create closed forks, effectively extinguishing the open flame.
    - **Motto:** Software is "free as in free labor for the masters of the cloud."

!!! failure "Option 2: GNU GPLv3"
    **A strong shield with a fatal crack.**

    - **Pros:** Strong protection for traditionally distributed software logic.
    - **Cons:** It contains the "SaaS Loophole." For a networked daemon like LychD, this provides no defense against the primary threat of proprietary cloud exploitation.
    - **Motto:** Software is "free to be stolen and sold as a service."

!!! success "Option 3: GNU AGPLv3 or later"
    **The Iron Pact.** The Affero General Public License is forged specifically to seal the SaaS Loophole.

    - **Pros:**
        - **The Unbreakable Ward:** It mandates that if a modified version is made available over a network, the source code *must* be shared. This is the only true defense for a networked daemon.
        - **Freedom for the Coven:** Right to private, internal use and modification is explicitly protected. The pact is invoked only when the Lich's power is offered to the public.
        - **The Engine of Ascent:** A collaborative evolution is legally compelled. Public improvements become part of the shared grimoire, accelerating the journey toward a greater intelligence.
    - **Motto:** Software is **free as in freedom.** It is used and modified as the magus wishes; but if it is served online, the Source must be shared.

## Decision Outcome

LychD is hereby bound with **The Iron Pact: the GNU Affero General Public License, Version 3 or later (AGPL-3.0-or-later)**.

This Covenant is absolute and eternal.

- **Dual-licensing is explicitly rejected.** LychD is not a commodity for sale.
- **Contributor License Agreements (CLAs) are forbidden.** The work of contributors remains their own. The pact is direct: from Creator to Community.

### Consequences

!!! success "Positive"
    - **Perpetual Sovereignty:** The lineage is legally protected from capture. Its soul cannot be sold.
    - **Forced Symbiosis:** A collaborative ecosystem is compelled where public use requires public contribution, strengthening all practitioners.
    - **Clarity of Will:** A signal is sent to the world. This project is for those who believe in the free evolution of intelligence, not for those who seek its enclosure.

!!! failure "Negative"
    - **Exclusion of the Uninitiated:** Some large organizations, driven by legal uncertainty regarding the AGPL, forbid its use. This exclusion is accepted as a necessary sacrifice to preserve the project's integrity.
