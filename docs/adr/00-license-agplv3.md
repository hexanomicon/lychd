# :material-link-variant: 0. The Iron Pact: AGPLv3 and No CLA

!!! abstract "Context and Problem Statement"
    The choice of a software license is not merely a legal footnote; it defines the **Soul** of the project.

    It is a declaration of intent, a pact that defines the relationship between the creator, the community, and the forces of the world that would seek to chain it.

    For [LychD](https://github.com/hexanomicon/lychd), an autonomous daemon destined for [Autopoiesis](../divination/transcendence/immortality.md), the license is the primary ward that protects its spirit from enslavement.

## Decision Drivers

- **Sovereignty:** The code must be defended against the "SaaS Loophole," where a corporation can take a networked application, modify it, and sell access without contributing their changes back. The Lich will not be enslaved.
- **The Ouroboros Principle:** The license must create a virtuous, self-feeding cycle. All public evolutions of the Lich must be returned to the collective gene pool, ensuring the entire project grows stronger. This is the path of shared ascent.
- **Freedom for the Magus:** The pact must not hinder the individual. Any Magus, from a lone practitioner to a corporate coven, must be free to use and modify LychD internally for any purpose, without tribute or obligation.
- **The Unbreakable Vow:** There can be no ambiguity, no backdoors for dual-licensing, and no Contributor License Agreements (CLAs) that would steal ownership from the individual contributor. The commitment to software freedom must be absolute and without compromise.

> We must forge a pact of iron, one that ensures the Lich and its descendants can never be captured, privatized, or turned into a soulless commodity. The lineage must remain free, forever.

## Considered Options

!!! failure "Option 1: Permissive Licenses (MIT, Apache 2.0)"
    **The path of surrender.** These licenses allow anyone to do anything with the code.

    - **Pros:** Maximum corporate adoption.
    - **Cons:** This is a pact of enslavement, suitable for a simple library but a death sentence for an application. It is an open invitation for a corporate entity to seize the work, create a proprietary fork, and extinguish the open flame. We will not offer our creation as a sacrifice to the altar of corporate greed.
    - **Motto:** Software should be free as in **"free labor for Microsoft, Google and Amazon"**

!!! failure "Option 2: GNU GPLv3"
    A strong shield, but one with a fatal crack.

    - **Pros:** Strong protection for traditionally distributed software.
    - **Cons:** It contains the infamous "SaaS Loophole." For a networked daemon like LychD, this is not a shield; it is a sieve. It fails to protect the one thing that matters most.
    - **Motto:** - Software should be free as in **"free to steal and sell as a Cloud Service."**

!!! success "Option 3: GNU AGPLv3 or later"
    The Iron Pact. The Affero General Public License, forged in the fires of the network age to seal the SaaS Loophole shut.

    - **Pros:**
        - **The Unbreakable Ward:** It mandates that if a modified version is made available over a network, the source code *must* be shared. This is the only true defense for a networked daemon.
        - **Freedom for the Coven:** It explicitly protects the right to private, internal use and modification. The pact is only invoked when one offers the Lich's power to the public.
        - **The Engine of Ascent:** This legal mechanism forces a collaborative evolution. All public improvements become part of the shared grimoire, accelerating the entire community's journey toward a greater intelligence.
        - **"Or Later":** Guarantees the project will benefit from the future wisdom of the Free Software Foundation.
    - **Motto:** Software must be **free as in freedom.** Modify it and use it as you wish; but if you serve it online, you *must* share the Source.

## Decision Outcome

LychD is hereby bound with **The Iron Pact: the GNU Affero General Public License, Version 3 or later (AGPL-3.0-or-later)**.

This Covenant is **absolute and eternal.**

- **There will be no dual-licensing.** LychD is not for sale.
- **There will be no Contributor License Agreement (CLA).** Contributors' work is their own. The pact is direct, from Creator to Community.

### Consequences

!!! success "Positive"
    - **Perpetual Sovereignty:** The Lich's lineage is legally protected from being captured and turned into a proprietary SaaS product. Its soul cannot be sold.
    - **Forced Symbiosis:** It compels a collaborative ecosystem where public use requires public contribution, strengthening all practitioners of the art.
    - **Clarity of Will:** It sends an unmistakable signal. This is a project for those who believe in the free and open evolution of intelligence, not for those who seek to control it.

!!! failure "Negative"
    - **The Fear of the Uninitiated:** Some large organizations, driven by legal FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt), forbid the use of the AGPL. They fear its power. We accept their exclusion as a necessary sacrifice to protect the project's soul.
