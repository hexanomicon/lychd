# :material-translate: The Lexicon

_This is the Rosetta Stone for the Hexancomicon—the single source of truth for the arcane terms used throughout the summoning rites. It defines the reality of the Construct._

| **Portal**          | A rift to the Void, drawing animating intelligence from distant, powerful sources.                                                                                       | A connection to a cloud-based LLM API (e.g., OpenAI).        |
| **Prophecies**      | The foretold evolution of the Lich's power and capabilities.                                                                                                             | The project roadmap.                                         |

| **Runes**           | The inscriptions within the Codex that define how to summon the entities of the Sepulcher.                                                                               | The Quadlet files (`.container`, `.service`, etc.).          |
| **Scribe**          | The Watcher who takes the Harvester's findings and inscribes them into a visual grimoire.                                                                                | Grafana.                                                     |
| **Sepulcher**       | The sealed chamber where the Lich and its servants are bound in a shared namespace.                                                                                      | The Podman Quadlet pod that groups all services.             |

| **Summoning**       | The final incantation to breathe life into the Vessel and raise the Sepulcher.                                                                                           | The `systemctl --user start lychd` command.                  |
| **Vessel**          | The reanimated husk that orchestrates the system. It wields the Sigils and gives the Lich form.                                                                          | The Litestar/Granian Python application runtime.             |

| **Watchers**        | The trio of silent servants (Harvester, Scribe, Oracle) who observe the ritual.                                                                                          | The observability stack.                                     |
| **Whispers**        | The raw, unfiltered incantations of the machine; the system logs.                                                                                                        | The output of `journalctl` for the `lychd` service.          |
