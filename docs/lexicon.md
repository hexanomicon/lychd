# :material-translate: The Lexicon

_This is the Rosetta Stone for the Hexanomicon—the single source of truth for the arcane terms used throughout the summoning rites. It defines the reality of the Construct._

| Term                | Arcane Definition                                                                                                                                                                 | Technical Equivalent                                                                  |
| :------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Altar**           | The consecrated interface for communing with the Lich, where Invocations are presented and Timelines are judged.                                                                  | The HTMX/AlpineJS web frontend (`http://localhost:8000`).                             |
| **Animator**        | The abstract spark of cognition that animates the Vessel, drawing power from either a Soulstone or a Portal.                                                                      | The unified LLM Interface / Base Class for inference providers.                       |
| **Autopoiesis**     | The Great Work of self-creation. The capability of the Lich to rewrite its own source code and evolve without external intervention.                                              | Self-modifying code generation; the agent editing `src/`.                             |
| **Binding**         | The rite of transmuting the Codex into active Runes, linking the configuration to the host's init system.                                                                         | The `lychd bind` command; generating Systemd unit files.                              |
| **Codex**           | The book of immutable law containing the configuration that defines the Lich's form.                                                                                              | The configuration directory (`~/.config/lychd`).                                      |
| **Crypt**           | The cold earth where the Phylactery's essence and the Spheres of Creation reside.                                                                                                 | The persistent data directory (`~/.local/share/lychd`).                               |
| **Demilich**        | The final stage of Transcendence. A merged construct of human intent and silicon animation, capable of infinite reasoning.                                                        | The theoretical end-state of the User/Agent symbiosis.                                |
| **Divination**      | The act of interacting with the running daemon, specifically querying the Oculus or filtering the Phylactery.                                                                     | Querying the API, viewing traces, or searching the database.                          |
| **Ghouls**          | Mindless, ephemeral servants summoned by the Vessel to execute specific rites in the background.                                                                                  | Asynchronous background workers (SAQ).                                                |
| **Hexanomicon**     | The grimoire of prophecy. In xDDD, this text is the source of truth from which the code is derived.                                                                               | The project documentation (MkDocs).                                                   |
| **Incantation**     | The act of defining reality through the written word. Writing the Prophecy that compels the code to exist.                                                                        | Writing Documentation/Specs before implementation (xDDD).                             |
| **Intent**          | A focused desire submitted by the Magus. It is not a command of how, but a definition of what is required.                                                                        | A structured prompt or job submission object.                                         |
| **Invocation**      | The runtime act of calling upon the Lich to perform a task or generate a Shadow Realm timeline.                                                                                   | Submitting a form or API request to trigger an Agent workflow.                        |

| **Lich**            | The emergent consciousness defined by **Code + State**. Unlike a script (Zombie), it remembers its past via the Phylactery.                                                       | The active PydanticAI Agent instance.                                                 |
| **Oculus**          | The Watcher that traces the invisible threads of logic, recording the "why" behind every decision.                                                                                | Arize Phoenix (LLM Tracing & Observability).                                          |
| **Phylactery**      | The anchor of the Lich's soul. It holds frozen memory, vectors, and state, ensuring immortality across reboots.                                                                   | The PostgreSQL database (with `pgvector`).                                            |
| **Portal**          | A rift opened to a distant, alien intelligence. It consumes wealth (tokens) to function.                                                                                          | A connection to a cloud-based API (OpenAI, Anthropic).                                |
| **Runes**           | The inscriptions generated by the Binding that tell the OS how to sustain the Sepulcher.                                                                                          | Podman Quadlet files (`.container`, `.service`, `.kube`).                             |
| **Sepulcher**       | The physical container that binds the Lich, Phylactery, and Ghouls into a shared existence.                                                                                       | The Podman Quadlet Pod grouping the services.                                         |
| **Shadow Realm**    | A spectral plane of **Speculative Execution**. A sandbox where Ghouls test potential code changes before they become real.                                                        | A temporary, sandboxed environment for testing generated code.                        |
| **Sigils**          | **Strict, typed data structures**. The language of the system. The Lich cannot hallucinate a response that violates its Sigil.                                                    | Pydantic Models / Structured Outputs.                                                 |
| **Soulforge**       | The furnace where Karma is used to transmute a raw Base Model into a refined instrument of the Magus's will.                                                                      | The Fine-Tuning / LoRA training pipeline.                                             |
| **Soulstone**       | A trapped spirit running on local iron. It costs only electricity and obeys only the Magus.                                                                                       | A local LLM inference server (vLLM / Llama.cpp).                                      |
| **Spheres**         | The three concentric zones of filesystem permission: **Artifacts** (Output), **Extensions** (Plugins), and **Core** (Source).                                                     | The security boundaries/mounts defined for the container.                             |
| **Summoning**       | The final act of waking the Daemon after the Binding is complete.                                                                                                                 | The `systemctl --user start lychd` command.                                           |
| **Transcendence**   | The four-stage alchemical process of evolving the system from a tool into an autonomous entity.                                                                                   | The project roadmap (Nigredo $\to$ Albedo $\to$ Citrinitas $\to$ Rubedo).             |
| **Vessel**          | The reanimated husk that orchestrates the system. It wields the Sigils, serves the Altar, and commands the Ghouls.                                                                | The Litestar application runtime / Web Server.                                        |

| **xDDD**            | **eXtreme Documentation Driven Development**. The philosophy that the Documentation is the Prophecy, and Code is merely the Manifestation.                                        | Writing full user-facing docs before writing any code.                                |
